# verify-links

Its purpose is to browse a website for its links and check they are
still alive. In other words it looks for broken links. Here is an
output example:

```
$ java -jar verify-links-0.1.0-standalone.jar http://yves-ba.com
Check the website  http://yves-ba.com
Fetching url:  http://yves-ba.com  ...  Ok.
Fetching url:  http://yves-ba.com/resune.html  ... BROKEN LINK!!
Fetching url:  http://yves-ba.com/blog.css  ...  Ok.
Fetching url:  http://htmlandcssbook.com/  ...  Ok.
...
```

Read the logs carefully, above. There is a dead link (trust me) and
its filename is resune.html. The link is mispelled and must have been
written as "resume.html".

### Implementation details

Basicaly, it works with a bread-first-search algorithm (well I've
tried but I ma still wondering how to implement a queue in Clojure)
without going out the domain name provided on the command line. In the
last example 'http://htmlandcssbook.com' is checked out, but its
content is not parsed in order and thus its own links are not
followed.


## Installation

Pull the project and run:

    $ lein uberjar


## Usage

Just push the root of the website you want to check as in:

    $ java -jar verify-links-0.1.0-standalone.jar http://yves-ba.com

## Options

No options for the moment.

Considering the verbose one, and reporting only broken links by default.

## Examples

...

### Bugs

* This tools does **not** look for urls in ```"src="``` attributes.
  (only for ```href=```)
* Also it does not parse the html grammar and does not discern *href*
attributes from plain text in the <pre><code> tags.
* The html is supposed to be well formed..

I didn't perform that much tests, it is just a toy project.

### TODO

* Wrap the java call around with a shell script.
